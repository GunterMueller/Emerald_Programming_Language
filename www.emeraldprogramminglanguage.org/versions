Description of versions:

Version 1.0 started 1985-07-10:
    Used a byte code interpreter.
    The old Eden kernel was used for booting.
    Before interpreting each byte code, the main loop of Eden was cycled.
    Emerald programs were handtranslated into byte codes.
    
Version 2.0 started 1986-09-14:
    Still used the byte code interpreter.
    Only change was to conform to a revision of the kernel data structures.

Version 3.0 started 1986-02-14:
    Revised version of kernel data structures.
    Timing document: timing1

Version 3.1 started 1986-02-24:
    Interpreter thrown out; handtranslating to VAX assembler code.
    Handtranslated to VAX assembly code.
    Removed the interpreter.
    Assembly code makes kernel calls by 'jsb'ing to a kernel stub
    which sets up a call to the real kernel call coded in C.
    Timing document:  timing2, of March 13th, 1986.

Version 3.2 started 1986-03-15:
    Optimized version of the C-code:
    reduced the number of "calls"
    put local variables into registers.
    Reduced the number of calls to the Eden mainloop by testing to see
    if it is empty before calling it.

Version 3.3 started March 17th:
    Optimized signal and wait but introduced bugs (ie. it didn't work).

Version 3.4 started March 18th:
    Avoided calls to the C-part of the kernel when monitor and condition
    queues are empty.
    Timing document: timing3 as of March 18th, 1986.

Version 3.5 started March 18th.
    Linked in the first compiled program and ran it on March 24th, 1986!

Version 4.0 started April 3rd, 1986.
    Major revisions of what code looks like in preperation for dynamic
    loading of code.

Version 4.1 started April 17th, 1986.
    Implementation of remote invocations started.

Version 5.0 started May 10th, 1986.
    Code loading.

Version 5.1 started May 15th, 1986.
    Register allocation modified.
