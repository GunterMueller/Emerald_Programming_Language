<H2>Introduction</H2>

This page describes the research on the Emerald Distributed Programming
Language.

<EM>Please be patient, this area is under construction.  Thanks!</EM>

<H2>Objectives</H2>

<UL>
  <LI> Develop and distribute an object-oriented programming language and system
    incorporating light-weight object migration.
  <LI> Investigate the issues in using such languages for distributed
    application development, particularly the areas of reliability and
    availability.

<H2>Software</H2>
Emerald is implemented in a style similar to Java (and Pascal, and Simula,
and ...):  the Emerald compiler
(which is writen in Emerald, of course) generates byte codes which are then
interpreted by a relatively portable interpreter.  The interpreter takes
care of finding remote objects, performing remote invocations, moving
objects, and doing both local and distributed garbage collection.
<P>
This is the second implementation of Emerald.  The original one generated
machine code for the machine of the year (originally Vax, then Sun3, Sun4,
and Alpha).  It is available from <A
HREF="http://www.diku.dk/research-groups/distlab">DIKU, at the University of
Copenhagen, Denmark</A>.  Their web pages are kind of a mess right now, but
they'll be back.
<P>
The implementation for Linux, FreeBSD, SPARC/Solaris, HP-PA/HPUX, and
Win95/NT is now available, look <A HREF="http://www.cs.ubc.ca/nest/dsg/emerald/dist/dist.html">here</A>
for details.
